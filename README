With this depository, I am trying to build a package named Cliques.
The aim is to reach at a stage where people can download cliques.tar.gz, extract them and the following command -

$ sudo python setup.py install

and thats all. They will be able to use all the functions I wrote.
The main file is cliques.py which contains the following functions.
1) all_maximal_cliques # To find all maximal cliques in the Undirected graph
2) coloring            # To find the coloring pater of the graph.
3) is_clique_k         # To check whether a clique of size k is present in graph or not
4) max_cliques	       # To find the maximum sized cliqe of a graph
5) random_graphs       # To generate random graphs for testing

The package also contains two modules written by me, named - 
1) my_module           # Contaning some useful basic functions
2) stack               # For using tree struture.
